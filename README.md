## Homework

Use the code from the lecture to write your own decoder. The key is provided for you.

Do not hard code the dictionary. You may use the provided emoji coded dictionary to create a new one. 

Add a new UIButton and connect the corresponding IBAction to the ViewController to decode a message. The coded message should be entered into the textfield. 

***Extra Credit***

Since the coded dictionary is created in the viewDidLoad function it is not completely. Write a function that takes in an integer as an argument and creates the offset of key to value to suit. For example if the integer is 5 then a would map onto f and b to g etc.
